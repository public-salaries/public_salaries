## Iowa Public Employee Salaries

### Sources

* Data for Iowa's state government employees from Des Moines Register Database: [hhttp://db.desmoinesregister.com/state-salaries-for-iowa/](http://db.desmoinesregister.com/state-salaries-for-iowa/). Des Moines Register collects it from ``Source: Iowa Department of Administrative Services. Updated: January 18, 2017.''

    **Notes:** 

    * ``Community Based Corrections officers and State Fair Board members are not included in this release of public data. A status of "TERMINATED" does not indicate that the employee was fired, only that the person no longer works in that position.''

    * ``Some data is truncated. Also, some employees show up multiple times in instances where they are listed under more than one department. Inaccuracies in the data should be referred to the Iowa Department of Administrative Services, the source of the state salary book.''
