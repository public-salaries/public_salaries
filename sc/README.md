    2. 'The S.C. Freedom of Information Act provides that all compensation for employees with earnings equaling $50,000 or more annually may be released. Compensation below that amount is available only in ranges. This data is provided by the Department of Adminstration's State Human Resources Division.

    Compensation information is entered by individual agencies into the Human Resources Information System (HRIS), our legacy personnel information system, or the South Carolina Enterprise Information System (SCEIS) and the Department of Adminstration cannot guarantee the accuracy of data presented. Questions about the compensation information presented or requests to fix errors should be directed to the HR department of the agency in question.

    The compensation information provided in this database is for employees in full-time equivalent positions. The information reflects compensation for employees divided among three fields: compensation without bonuses, bonuses, and total compensation. The compensation field may include other types of compensation not included in base pay. All compensation and earnings are based on the current fiscal year.

    Additionally, for employees employed by state agencies whose payroll is processed through SCEIS, compensation includes payroll data, which includes overtime, bonuses, on-call, and call back pay. Compensation data does not reflect any pay reductions that would result from employee furloughs. Due to the limitations of HRIS, the compensation for the employees of The Citadel, Clemson University, College of Charleston, Coastal Carolina University, Francis Marion University, Lander University, South Carolina State University, University of South Carolina, Winthrop University, Medical University of South Carolina, and the Technical College System does not include all types of pay.

    Certain agencies are exempt from oversight by the Human Resources Division and their information is not included. Agencies not included in this data are: ADMINISTRATIVE LAW COURT, EDUCATION OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE, LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COUNCIL, LEGISLATIVE COUNCIL, LEGISLATIVE PRINTING, INFORMATION AND TECHNOLOGY SERVICES, LOTTERY COMMISSION, MEDICAL UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL AUTHORITY, SANTEE COOPER, S.C. COMMISSION ON PROSECUTION COORDINATION, S.C. HOUSE STAFF, S.C. JOBS - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY, S.C. JUDICIAL DEPARTMENT, S.C. RESEARCH AUTHORITY, S.C. SENATE STAFF, S.C. STATE PORTS AUTHORITY , OFFICE OF REGULATORY STAFF.'
