From the website:
  
    "Employee Compensation is calculated from actual fiscal year payroll payments. Totals are for the fiscal year which runs from July 1 through June 30. Data will be updated annually after the end of the fiscal year. The total cost of state employees includes both compensation and fringe benefits. The fringe benefits amount reflect the employers costs for the normal cost of retirement, health insurance, group life insurance, FICA, Medicare, and unemployment compensation. In general these fringe benefits are calculated as a percentage of salary. Please note the fringe benefit amounts do not reflect costs associated with the state’s unfunded pension liability for the state’s defined benefit plans. Additional information on the individual components that make up both compensation and fringe benefits are described in the glossary.

    Please note that the amounts shown may represent partial year totals if the employee was not employed for the full year or was employed by multiple agencies. Most state employees are supported entirely by the General Fund, which is the main operating fund of state government. However, some state employees are supported through other state funds or federal funds, in whole or in part."
