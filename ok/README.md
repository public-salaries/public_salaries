1. Data on the state and university salaries from 2010--2016 is from https://data.ok.gov/ which takes data from https://omes.ok.gov

2. For each year, there are generally 4 CSVs---1 for each quarter. In 2010, we just have data from q3 and q4 and in 2015, there is an additional aggregate payroll file.

3. Employee first name isn't provided. Only first name's initial is provided.

4. Notes from the website:
    "The payroll data represents the amount paid to an employee during the reported time period. In addition to regular pay, these amounts may include other pay types such as overtime, longevity, shift differential or terminal pay. This amount does not include any state share costs associated with the payroll i.e. FICA, state share retirement, etc. This amount may vary from an employee’s ‘salary’ due to pay adjustments or pay period timing. The payroll information will be updated monthly after the end of the month. For example, July information will be added in August."
