### Notes from the Website

    "Employees of West Virginiaâ€™s school districts are paid with taxpayer dollars.

    Some school districts, such as Kanawha County, make the salaries of their employees easily available to the public. Others say the information should not be made public.

    The Data Center is dedicated to obtaining the 2015-2016 payrolls for school districts throughout the state, compiling and posting them here in order to provide greater transparency to readers.

    As more school districts provide us with the data, we will update this database.

    Curious about what a teacher, administrator or janitor makes? All you have to do is search the database below.

    The best way to search through this is by hitting control and F on your keyboard and then searching for a person, their position, school district or location."
